# Purpose

This Discord bot is originally intended to target a collection of spam bots that frequent FSU community servers.

In order to categorize the different spam campaigns this bot targets, I've made this table, which designates a campaign's features to a name to help organize it.

| Classifier     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Features                                                                                                                                   |

| FreeMacbook    | Offers a free MacBook, strictly first-come-first-serve, requiring the victim to DM or text them. After contact, the attacker requires the victim to pay shipping (FedEx, commonly) for the MacBook which the attacker will accept via a variety of modern payment methods including Apple Cash, Venmo, Zelle, and PayPal.<br/><br/>This campaign uses Discord accounts with varying reputation, never having a connected account, but may have been created up to 3 years prior to engagement and with or without a custom profile photo. | > Run-on sentences and strange grammar<br />> Typically advertises a MacBook Air 2020<br/>> Exactly "Strictly First come first serve"<br/> |
| ConcertTickets | Offers concert tickets to upcoming shows in the Florida area, typically the Hard Rock. Requires the victim to DM them, which they will then provide some form of "proof" that shows they have these tickets. The attacker will request payment from providers such as Apple Cash, Venmo, Zelle, or PayPal.<br/><br/>There is not yet good data for this campaign.                                                                                                                                                                         | > Taylor Swift, among other artists<br/>                                                                                                   |

The end goal is to be able to block members that are a part of these campaigns from joining the server at all, then ban them if they make it past that, then ban them and delete the solicitation message they send.
