@everyone I’ve got 4 tickets to Coldplay’s Miami show on Sunday, July 27 at 6:45 PM.
Venue: Hard Rock Stadium
They’re mobile tickets, transferable, and I’m only selling because of a schedule conflict.

You can grab all 4 or just a couple.

This truly breaks my heart to write…

I have 4 amazing seats for the Coldplay concert on Sunday, July 27, 2025 at 6:45 PM at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, Florida incredible view, close to the stage, perfect for soaking in every note, every moment.

I was counting down the days for this night Coldplay is more than just music to me, it’s been a source of healing, joy, and memories.

But life had other plans.
My sister was in a terrible accident, and I need to fly out immediately to be with her. She’s going through a really fragile recovery right now, and family comes first.

I’m devastated to miss the concert, but even more than that, I’d love for someone who truly loves Coldplay to experience it in my place.

If this speaks to your heart or if you know someone who’s always dreamed of seeing them live please reach out.

Your support during this hard time would mean the world to me. 🙏🏼💗

please dm me on IMessage if you need them :  wilkersonannika@gmail.com
